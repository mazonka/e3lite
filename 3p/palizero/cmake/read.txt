The high-level instructions for building projects that use PALISADE are as follows:

Build and install PALISADE using "make install". This will copy the PALISADE library files and header files to the directory chosen for installation.
Create the folder for your project on your system.
Copy CMakeLists.User.txt from the root directory of the git repo to the folder for your project.
Rename CMakeLists.User.txt to CMakeLists.txt.
Update CMakeLists.txt to specify the name of the executable and the source code files. For example, include the following line

add_executable( fhe-demo simple-integers.cpp )

If using MinGW/Windows (skip this step for other platforms), copy PreLoad.cmake from the root directory of the git repo to the folder of your project.
Create the build directory and cd to it.

mkdir build
cd build

Run

cmake ..

Run "make" to build the executable.
