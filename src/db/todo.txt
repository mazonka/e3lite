there is an incosistency with E3NOABORT

circuit functions are 'noexcept' but gates are not

Since circuit functions are 'noexcept' no exception can propagate
even with E3NOABORT=1

We have to do either

1. put 'noexcept' on gate functions and accept that 
E3NOABORT does not work on gate level at all regardless of the option

or

2. remove 'noexcept' from all circuit functions. That may worsen the
performance for fast schemes. That must be done for the
interface circuit.h as well as for the all generated circuits.
